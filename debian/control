Description: French dictionary for hunspell (dependency package)
 This is a dependency package that installs one (and only one) of the four
 available French dictionaries. These dictionaries differ in the way they apply
 the spelling reform of 1990:
 .
  - hunspell-fr-classical (recommended): this dictionary offers the usual
    spelling of French, with in addition some new spellings correcting past
    inconsistencies.
 .
  - hunspell-fr-revised: this dictionary includes only the new spelling for the
    words that were affected by the 1990 reform.
 .
  - hunspell-fr-comprehensive: this dictionary includes both the old and the new
    spelling for the words that were affected by the 1990 reform.
